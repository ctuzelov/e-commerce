# Microservices Architecture

## 2. Define Protobuf Schemas

### Define Protobufs

- [ ] Create a directory for protobuf definitions.
- [ ] Define common messages and services for:
  - [ ] **User Service**
  - [ ] **Product Service**
  - [ ] **Order Service**
  - [ ] **Payment Service**
- [ ] Compile protobufs using `protoc` to generate Go code.

## 3. Develop Microservices

### User Service

- [ ] Create the Go module for User Service.
- [ ] Implement `user.proto` with methods for registration, login, and profile management.
- [ ] Set up a gRPC server.
- [ ] Connect to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing user data.
- [ ] Implement business logic for user management.
- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests.

### Product Service

- [ ] Create the Go module for Product Service.
- [ ] Implement `product.proto` with methods for CRUD operations on products.
- [ ] Set up a gRPC server.
- [ ] Connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB) for storing product data.
- [ ] Implement business logic for product management.
- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests.

### Order Service

- [ ] Create the Go module for Order Service.
- [ ] Implement `order.proto` with methods for creating orders, updating status, and fetching order history.
- [ ] Set up a gRPC server.
- [ ] Connect to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing order data.
- [ ] Implement business logic for order processing.
- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests.

### Payment Service

- [ ] Create the Go module for Payment Service.
- [ ] Implement `payment.proto` with methods for processing payments and managing transactions.
- [ ] Set up a gRPC server.
- [ ] Connect to a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- [ ] Implement business logic for payment processing.
- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests.

## 4. API Gateway and Service Discovery

### API Gateway Setup

- [ ] Choose an API Gateway solution (e.g., Kong, NGINX).
- [ ] Configure routing to forward requests to appropriate microservices.
- [ ] Implement security measures (authentication, rate limiting).

### Service Discovery

- [ ] Implement service discovery (e.g., using Consul or etcd).
- [ ] Ensure microservices can register themselves and discover each other.

## 5. Configuration and Infrastructure

### Configuration Management

- [ ] Use a configuration management tool (e.g., Viper in Go).
- [ ] Store configuration settings (e.g., environment variables, config files).

### Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] Implement centralized logging (e.g., using ELK stack).
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

### Security

- [ ] Implement TLS/SSL for secure communication between microservices.
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT tokens).
